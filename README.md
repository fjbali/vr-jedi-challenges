# vr-jedi-challenges
This is a remake and enhancement of Lenovo's $100 (recently dropped from $200) [AR Jedi Challenges product](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/jedichallenges/).
Currently, the iconic lightsaber training scene from [A New Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X69NCLxwLEY), where Obi-wan trains Luke has an alpha version.
It can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/UE0PwMJboGc)

The puzzle and local multiplayer features from Lenovo's product are not yet implemented.
